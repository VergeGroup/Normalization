# Normalization

State management plays a crucial role in building efficient and maintainable applications. One of the essential aspects of state management is organizing the data in a way that simplifies its manipulation and usage. This is where normalization becomes vital.

Normalization is the process of structuring data in a way that eliminates redundancy and ensures data consistency. It is essential in state-management libraries because it significantly reduces the computational complexity of operations and makes it easier to manage the state.

Let’s take a look at an example to illustrate the difference between normalized and denormalized data structures.

Redux’s normalization explanations are also useful to understatnd the concept of normalization.
